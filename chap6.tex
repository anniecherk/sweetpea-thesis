\chapter{Implementing SweetPea}

- chapter summary

\section{Language Implementation: Decisions and Alternatives}

- section summary

\subsection{Embedding Language}

- was in haskell

- now is in python

- in the future, perhaps in racket for macro options

- why is this important / consequences to these choices

\subsection{Internal Representations}

- pros / cons of using one-hot vs binary : trade-off between more variables and more clauses

- todo: more examples

\section{Runtime Implementation: Tsietin Transform}
- necessary to efficeintly encode on the scale of 60 of these 120 boolean vars need to be true

- how efficient is it?

- works by mimicing popcount circuitry

- generates a bunch of "junk variables"

\subsection{Binding Variables: Iff}
- new variable "equals" if their values are in lockstep

\subsection{Adders}
- half adder example

- full adder example

\subsection{Ripple Carry Adders}
- multiple options here, the one I went with

- trade-offs of options

\subsection{Pop Count Circuit}
- pop count circuit example

\subsection{Exhaustive Testing}

- example of input / output: see how it's prone to error

- tested for a given size all assignments
