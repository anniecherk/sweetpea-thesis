\chapter{Conclusion}

This thesis presented SweetPea, a system for concisely describing experimental designs and rigerously generating experimental sequences that satisfy the design. SweetPea's high-level language allows scientists to declaratively describe the experiment they want to conduct rather than forcing them to mechanically describe how to construct their experimental sequences. This allows scientists to write concise, correct programs which describe their experiments, and produce unbiased experimental sequences; these programs can then be published and shared to document the experiment and facilitate replicability.


When a psychologist runs an experiment, it is important that the randomized experimental sequences that they show to the subjects represent a truely random sample of experimental sequences which express the experiment they are trying to run. Unfortunantly, it is difficult to construct these experimental sequences while guaranteeing that the construction isn't favoring certain sequences over others; this is an NP-hard problem for a large problem size.
